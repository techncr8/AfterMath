<h4> Digital Art Workshops  </h4>      
<p> A series of 3 digital art workshops are starting on the 8th of July, and every two weeks following (22 July and 5 August) on Saturday afternoons. We are flying some amazing artists in from around NZ and will be introducing participants to a broad spectrum of the digital arts.</p>
<p> The workshops are being developed to be accessible to all and will be especially interesting to those that are aware of the impact of technology on society and how we communicate those issues. We will also be covering the more speculative aspects of the art including how implementation details relate to the emerging philosophy of the Digital.</p> 
<p>Stay tuned for a full lineup and to purchase tickets</p>
